      <div class="an-alternative-cab-service-app">
        An alternative cab service app to other apps like Ola, and Uber, which
        control the work environment for drivers and take chunks of cuts from
        their earnings as commission, making life difficult for a regular
        driver. This P2P Carpooling DAPP will connect drivers directly with
        customers to share a ride. The transactions will go through smart
        contracts run on blockchain technology and paid via cryptocurrency.
        Anyone can register as a driver and publish rides for people to book.
        This DAPP makes the process more hassle-free, making it more
        transparent.
